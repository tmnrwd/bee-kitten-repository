            <em>Here are some facts about bees:</em>
            <ul></ul>
            <li>Honey bees must gather nectar from two million flowers to make one pound of honey.</li>
            <li>One bee has to fly about 90,000 miles – three times around the globe – to make one pound of honey.</li>
            <li>The average honey bee can only take off and land a total of 1,400 times before its wings stop working.</li>
            <li>The average bee will make only 1/12th of a teaspoon of honey in its lifetime.</li>
            <li>The queen bee is usually too large to leave her chamber, and has a constant stream of drones who mate with her.</li>
            <li>When a drone has finished its mating duties, its brain alters over the course of a day, and it returns to being a worker bee.</li>
            <li>A honey bee visits 50 to 100 flowers during a collection trip.</li>

            If you want to get me a Christmas present, here are some ideas:
            <ol>
                <li>A partridge in a pear tree</li>
                <li>Two turtle doves</li>
                <li>Three french hens</li>

            <p class="big-text">This is my favourite Bible quote. Read it and ponder the mysteries of the scripture:</p>
            <ul></ul>
            <li>Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</li>
            <li>For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</li>
            <li>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</li>
